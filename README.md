Morenaas - Movie Rental As A Service

API developed in JavaScript with Node, Express, Postgres, Moment Timezone, JWT authentication, CPF and Phone validation of Brazilian users, sends email through Nodemailer, imports PDF files through Multer and Swagger documentation in the OpenAPI 3 specification.

The API creates users, movies and fictitious rentals, retrieves data of users and movies recorded in the database, updates data and deletes users (CRUD), according to the user's access profile.

This project is already published on Heroku at https://morenaas.herokuapp.com/.

A Front End with React will soon be developed, so that this project is a complete PERN.

Please contribute to the development of this API, let us know if you encounter problems or have suggestions for improvement.
